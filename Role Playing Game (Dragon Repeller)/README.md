# Building a Role Playing Game - Dragon Repeller

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be used to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I have learned about the fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. I learned how to work with _arrays, strings, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements_, and more.
